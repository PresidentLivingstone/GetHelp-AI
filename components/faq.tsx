    id: "response-time",
    question: "How fast is the response?",

    id: "solution-quality",
    question: "How accurate are the solutions?",
    answer: "Our AI generates high-quality solutions based on best practices and up-to-date knowledge. However, for critical issues (especially in technical, medical, or legal domains), we recommend verifying the information with a specialist.",

    id: "data-privacy",
    question: "What data do you send to the AI?",
    answer: "Only the three fields you provide: your problem description, category, and priority level. All data is transmitted securely via encrypted webhook directly from our server, never exposing API keys in the client.",

  {
    id: "history",
    question: "Can I access my previous solutions?",
    answer: "Yes. All your past solutions appear in the 'Recent Solutions' section, organized by category and priority. You can filter, expand, and reference them at any time.",

  {
    id: "ai-model",
    question: "What AI technology powers the solutions?",
    answer: "We use a specialized version of a large language model that's been fine-tuned to provide concise, actionable solutions across different domains. The model is regularly updated to ensure accuracy and relevance.",

  {
    id: "usage-limits",
    question: "Are there limits to how many questions I can ask?",
